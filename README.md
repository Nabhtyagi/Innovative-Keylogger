# INNOVATIVE KEYLOGGER
**Keylogger** : It is a software-based computer program designed to record any input from the keys from the keyboard. Using this utility it works as a spyware where clients are unaware their activities are being followed and are being tracked. Keyloggers can be utilized for variety of purposes; hackers may utilize them to maliciously access your private data, while employers might use them to monitor employee activities.

## Our Project
